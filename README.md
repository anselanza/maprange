# Map Range in JS

Inspired by the map function in Processing.

Differs from the following similar JS packages:
*  [map-range](https://www.npmjs.com/package/map-range) and [@compactjs/remap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@compactjs/remap) do not include optional clamping
* [range-map](https://www.npmjs.com/package/range-map) always rounds resulting numbers
